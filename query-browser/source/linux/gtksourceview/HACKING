Coding Style
============

All new code in GtkSourceView should follow the GNOME Programming Guidelines
(http://developer.gnome.org/doc/guides/programming-guidelines/), except
braces for which we prefer the "hanging" style. I.e.:

	if (x)
	{
		code_block;
	}

Braces are optional if code_block is just one line of code, but be
consistent for multiple branched statements suchs as if/else if/else.

If you add new API to GtkSourceView you must provide gtk-doc style
comments fully documenting all the functions you're adding.
