             Color,Caret,Hotspot etc properties added.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  05/10/2004 Removed the typedef for TSciLangName (no longer needed)
             Renamed the SetLLanguage procedure to SetLanguageStr
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  13/10/2004 Added help using ClassExplorer 6.0, Use the helpgenerator to
             generate the help.
             Changed the ViewWSpace from boolean to sciWSMode, to allow all settings.
             The TExtensionMapper is moved to SciPropertyMgr.pas
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  15/10/2004 BUGFIX:
             Fixed a bug in GetStyleListStr. Didn't set the LanguageStr when
             nullitm didn't exits, and it was created. Caused
             TScintillaOptionsDlg to throw an exception with list error
             when you tried to add a style and no nullstyles existed.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  17/10/2004 Removed TScintillaBase.LoadSettingsFromStream and TScintillaBase.SaveSettingsToStream, unnessecary now.
             Added property editor for the Lexer property of TSciLangItem
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  24/10/2004 Removed the TLexerNamesMap class, and the LexerMapper function
             these are now part of the TSciSynLexer class (functions AddLanguage,
             DupLanguage,RemoveLanguage,FillListWithLanguages)
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  25/10/2004 Redesigned the whole OptionsForm. Added add,copy,remove languages buttons.
             Added Active Hotspot options.
             The Keywords page doesn't exist anymore, it is now a part of the
             Highlighter page.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  26/10/2004 Moved the GetLexerMapperProps function to TSciSynLexer.GetLexerProps (ScintillaSynLexer.Pas)
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  27/10/2004 Renamed the TSciSynLexer.LanguageStr to SelectedLanguage,
             and the SetLanguageStr to SetSelectedLanguage.
             Renamed TSciLangList.GetStyleListStr to GetStyleList.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  29/10/2004 Added The TSciHotSpot subclass to manage Active hotspot settings (TScintilla.ActiveHotspotOpts).
             Changed the shortcuts for Paraup/Paradown/Wordpartleft/wordpartright * commands 'cause it didn't work with
             []/\ in all languages. Seemed more logical also.
             removed the commenting of the stuttered commands.. Don't know if these work, but..
             Removed the opKeywords from the TSciOptionPage enum. No longer needed.
             Renamed the opOptions2 to opColors
             Changed the TSciSearchReplace.Editor property from TScintilla to TScintillaBase class.
             Wasn't any need for the extra properties to use this dialog.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  30/10/2004 Added Comment* properties to TSciLangItem, used by
             CommentBox/CommentBlock functions in TScintilla.
             Added CommentBox and CommentBlock functions.
             Added TSciLangSettings definitions for a number of languages.
             Added TSciLangSettings record, and the AddIt function has a new parameter of
             this type to define the commenting style and other things for the languages.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  02/11/2004 Refreshed against version 1.62 of scintilla.iface
             No longer displays a list of all lexers in the OptionsForm, now only defined languages
             are displayed, i.e those defined in the Highlighter.LanguageList.
             If you want to add a language, click Add and set the languagename and
             the lexer to use for it. You can have as many languages defined as you wish.
             Added the Asn1 and Vhdl lexer styles (Scintilla v1.62).
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  03/11/2004 Added the protected properties CallTipStartChars and CallTipEndChars to TScintillaAuto.
             Changed the packages to not include the .dcr files in the scite.bpl or scited7.bpl when
             compiled. Wasted diskspace.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  04/11/2004 BUGFIX: When a new keylist was added, and you typed a description then the text
             in the listbox wasn't updated. Fixed.

  07/11/2004 Reintroduced the ExportToHTML function originally found in the DelphiWrapper
             to TScintilla as requested by Kiriakos Vlahos,
             some changes was needed to fit with the new layout of the components.
             a bug in the function was also fixed (didn't use the correct styles,
             was lagging a style behind).
             Made the Lines property published as requested by Kiriakos Vlahos.
             Exposed the OnClick event as Published.
             The SelectedLanguage property is made into a selectionlist of the defined languages,
             no need to remember the languagenames you'd created anymore.
             The TSciLexerPropertyEditor was fixed to get the list of lexers from the FillListWithLanguages
             function in the proper way, instead of creating a temporary TSciSynLexer first.
             BUGS/Features:
             AutoCompleteOps.AStrings wasn't searched when autocompleting,
             changed the code to search AutoCompleteOps.AStrings when AutoCompleteOps.CompleteWord is False.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)
  08/11/2004 Added ActiveDocument property to TSciDocumentTabControl to make it easier to retrieve
             the saved settings for the currently active document.
  09/11/2004 SelectionFileName added two extra bytes (nullbytes), Fixed.
             A bug was found in RangeIsAllWhiteSpace. It did exactly the opposite
             of what it should do.
             Added EdgeColumn,EdgeType,EdgeColor etc to TSciOptionsDlg
             Some redesign of the Options page to make it fit.. To be adjusted later.
             Moved the CharPos function to SciLexer.Pas. Was needed more places now.
  10/11/2004 CommentBox and CommentStream now takes a boolean parameter 'includecommentcharsinselection'
             that if it's True it selects the commenting strings also, if not then the commenting
             strings are not selected.
  11/11/2004 Added the FlipVars function.
             Removed the IsDirty property. Modified did just the same actually.
             Added per tab hinting for TSciDocumentTabControl. Displays the full pathname of the file when ShowHint is True.
  18/11/2004 Removed the TScintillaAuto component, this is now replaced with TSciAutoComplete.
             Added three new components TSciCallTips, TSciAutoComplete, TSciMacroRecorder.
             Now you can select exactly what predefined languages to add, not just all or nothing.

  26/11/2004 Added the property DefaultExt for setting the default file extension in TSciDocumentTabControl.
             Added calls to the OnDetectHighlighter when we're attached to
             a TScintilla component, and we're attaching ourself.
             Introduced the TSciAbbrevManager component.
  30/11/2004 Added TScintillaDB and TScintillaMemoDB (database components).
  01/12/2004- 
	04/01/2005 Helpdescriptions.txt: Added assorted new items.
	           Added extra help to the gutter0-2 for how to set colors.
  02/12/2004 TSciPropertyLoader: Moved all standalone functions to sciUtils.pas. They can, and probably will be used
             by other units also.
             Changed the format of the expected properties file.. The new one somewhat resembles
             ini files, but with at least one distinction: You can continue the line with the '\' character,
             as in C++..                      
             
  05/01/2005 TSciDocumentTabControl: Changed some of the calling to FOnDetectHighlighter, tried to minimize number of calls.
             Added the OnOpenedAndInited event, this is fired only when Open is called, and is called just
             before the function exits when successful.. May be the ideal place to add updatingcode which
             is dependent on the current highlighter, as it's not completely loaded until just at this time.
  08/01/2005 TScintillaMemo: Removed CharAddedAutocomplete.. no longer used.
             Added AutoCloseBraces,AutoCloseQuotes.
             
  09/01/2005 TSciAbbrevManager: Added expansion of a template inside another (if AllowTemplateMacros is True)
             Use <^nameoftemplate> to include one template inside another.. It keeps
             expanding until no more expansion are possible.. If a templatename isn't found
             it just removes the templateinclusion i.e <^whatever>, and continues expanding the rest..
  10/01/2005 TSciAbbrevManager: Added the event OnTemplateMacro to match a templatemacro with something builtin.. All of these
             starts with <^- instead.. Two is implemented here.. PROMPT prompt|caption  and ROW (Returns linenumber).
  24/01/2005 TSciDocumentTabControl: Fixed the Close function so that when the last document is closed, the OnChange is called correctly and,
             in Remove the Modified is sat to False when we're closing the last document..
  25/01/2005 Fixed the styledefinition for XML. It seems it wasn't too fond
             of no keywordlists at all.
  25/01/2005 TSciPropertyLoader: Added the functions AddBool,AddInt,GetBool,GetInt.
             Renamed the GetOtherSetting to GetOther, and the SetOtherSetting to SetOther.
             
  26/01/2005 TSciDocumentTabControl: Found a somewhat serious bug. When the character '\' is the last in the file,
             and there's no following line, then an exception was thrown 'cause a while statement
             did the walkin one too many times. Fixed.
  29/01/2005 Added PHP as a language in it's own right, it is almost exactly the same as
             the HTML languagedefinition, but for some of the other components it's an
             advantage to have the PHP separated somewhat.

	12/04/2005 SciLangFiller.Pas:
	           Now when we add languages we check if the style/keywordlist exists, and if so
						 then don't overwrite/or add double up.

	12/04/2005 SciCallTips.Pas:
	           Added the OnBeforeShow event
	12/04/2005 SciAutoComplete.Pas:
	           Added the OnBeforeShow event
	12/04/2005 SciPropertyMgr.Pas:
	           Corrected the .dpk and .dpr to map to the Pascal language.
	15/04/2005 SciLexerMemo.Pas:
	           Removed the Add*Handler and Remove*Handler, and replaced them
						 with AddHandler and RemoveHandler wich takes a enum parameter
						 to tell which type handler it is.
	
						 Fixed the doSci* functions to no longer call Execute*Handler
						 as the inherited TScintillaBase calls it via the events..
						 Earlier it caused the handlers to be called twice (or more), if there
						 was any handlers assigned via TSciController. A bug..
						 
  15/04/2005 SciAutoComplete.Pas:
	           Added MaxWidth,MaxHeight properties and the OnAutoCSelection event
						 to conform to Scintilla 1.63.

	15/04/2005 SciControllerHander.Pas:
	           Changed the connection to the ownerclass to wait until the
						 class calls TSciController.Connect, cause it didn't get the
						 initialized events of the owner when the owner created TSciController
						 in the Create constructor.

	18/04/2005 SciFileExtensionsManager.Pas:
 	           Moved the ExtMapper from SciPropertyMgr to SciFileExtensionsManager.Pas, and
						 changed the way the extensions are stored.. Now it's a collection of items,
						 with two properties. Language, and Extensions. Use ExtMapper.Add to add new extensions.
						 - FillExtensionsMap is not called automatically because if the language isn't
						 in the languagemanager, then it's possible it is created on the fly (with the NULL
						 settings), and that may not be what you wished for.
						 
						 You CAN use the old extensionmapper, but then you need to comment out the {$Define USENEWEXTENSIONMAPPER}
						 in SciCommonDef.Inc.
						 
	           First release
	18/04/2005 SciPropertyMgr.Pas:
	           Changed the implementation of ExtensionManager, and moved it to SciFileExtensionsManager.pas,
						 and deprecated the old version which still is here when you uncomment
						 USENEWEXTENSIONMAPPER in SciCommonDef.Inc
						 The new propertyformat for fileextensions is now:
						 [Extensions]
						 C++/C=.cpp;.c;.cxx
						 
						 if the propetyloader encounters old style, then it's those are converted
						 to the new style when that propertyfile is saved again.
						 
	19/04/2005 SciKeyBindings.Pas:
	           Added the TSciCommandRecHeader, TSciCommandRec records.
						 Added the StickyCaret to the command list. (v1.63)
						 Added VCStyle property..
	20/04/2005 SciLexerMemo.Pas:
	           Added LocateIndicator, LengthOfIndicator, RemoveIndicator,ShowIndicatorAt.
	04/05/2005 BUGFIX 01:
						 Fixed a bug which caused that if any char keys pressed triggered
						 the mnemoniced control when the key matched the mnemonics without ALT.
						 hdalis@users.sourceforge.net
	04/05/2005 SciLexer.Pas:
	           Added the GetDelphiSciVersion,GetDelphiSciVersionStr,GetDelphiSciURL,
						 for easy use in an aboutbox.

	15/05/2005 SciPropertyMgr.Pas:
	           Removed all references to ValueExtract, as it was unneccesary.
	15/05/2005 SciUtils.Pas:
	           Renamed StrToken to WordBefore, and ReplaceChar to ReplaceAChar because the old names clashed
						 with JVCL. Added ToBool, and ToIntAndCheck.
						 Removed all references to ValueExtract, as it was unneccesary.
  18/05/2005 SciPropertyMgr.Pas:
	           The property StoreMinimal was added. When true, the propertyloaded
						 saves only the miniumum. i.e extensions,styles,keywords etc.
						 but only the style property under the [default] tag.
						 This is to ease the use if most of the config is saved
						 to the registry.
  20/05/2005 SciKeyBindings.Pas:
	           Added LoadKeyCommands and SaveKeyCommands (both stream and file).
	27/05/2005 EdOptionsWin.pas:
	           Swapped the columns in the KeyBindings listview. Added sort.
	           Fixed a couple of memoryleaks, as suggested by Mak.
  28/05/2005 Added the TSciPrinter component. This component is not very much tested
	           yet.. But seems to work.
