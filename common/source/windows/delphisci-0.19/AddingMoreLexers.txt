If you wish to add those lexers at runtime, use AddLexer
(the function above this).
That function checks whether a lexer already exists,
and if not, adds it to the list.

These will show up in the OptionsDialog (when you use Add language)
when the dialog is called after they are added.

NOTE: As the scintilla control treats the lexers casesensitive, 
this is also casesensitive.

If you want to show them at designtime, instead of the above do this:

Open the file MoreLexers.inc and add a statement like this:
Add('lexername');

Recompile, and you're done.. (BUILD, as delphi doesn't check dates on
includes it seems)

Add more lexernames there, if there are more lexers in your version
of 'SciLexer.Dll', i.e new version, custombuilt or other..

All lexers which are added there is also selectable from within the IDE.
