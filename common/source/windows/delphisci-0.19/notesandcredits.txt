These components has only been tested with Delphi 7,Delphi 2005,
and C++ Builder 6, and some testing is being done on C++ Builder 5
by Udo.

In Delphi 2005 it only works as an Win32 component.

If you get them to work with other versions of those compilers
then let me know.. I'm interested in the packagefiles you've created,
and/or other adjustments that needed to be done.

Some of these components are inspired and in some parts
inherited from the relatively basic DelphiWrapper v1.4 at
http://www.pnotepad.org/scintilla/
by Simon Steele (ss@pnotepad.org), and later improved by
(kvlahos@london.edu).

The TscFontComboBox (by Stefan Cruysberghs http://www.scip.be)
(renamed to TtcFontComboBox) with some fixes etc are used by the
TScintillaOptionsDlg component, and is also exposed on the
componentbar itself.

The ConfirmReplaceDlg and ReplaceTextDlg from the
SynEdit project (http://SynEdit.SourceForge.net) are also used.
