INSTALLATION OF SCINTILLA COMPONENTS FOR DELPHI

NOTE: As of version 0.19, I've began to use versioning for the components.
This means that version 0.19 and later components will no longer interfere
with eachother when installed in the system directory on the same computer,
and programs compiled with different versions can be used,
and no longer interfere with eachother.

i.e you can have both version 0.19 and 0.20++ inside the system directory.

This also means that you need to uninstall the current version of the
Delphi Scintilla Interface Components packages in Delphi or C++ Builder
(if they are installed), compile the new packages, and then install the
new versions of the files as specified below. 

The reason for this is because the filename of the .BPL files now
changes with each version, but the .dcp/.lib/.bpi filenames
doesn't change.

COMPILING THE PACKAGES:

DELPHI 7 (In the D7 Packages directory)

Open DelphiSciD7.BPG, and select BUILD ALL or

Open Scit.DPK. If a messagebox about TTcFontComboBox not existing appears,
just click cancel. Compile the package the usual way.

Open DScit.DPK, and compile it the usual way.

/// The packages below requires that your version of Delphi has the
/// Borland Database components (it doesn't exist in the Personal version I think)

Open ScitDB.DPK. Compile the package the usual way.

Open DScitDB.DPK, and compile it the usual way.

Delphi 2005 (In the D9 Packages directory)

Open DelphiSciD9.BPG, and select BUILD ALL or:

See above the instructions on Delphi 7.


C++ BUILDER 6 (In the C6 Packages directory)

Open DelphiSciC6.BPG, and select BUILD ALL or:

See above, but with the filenames Scit.BPK and DScit.BPK.
And ScitDB.BPK, DScitDB.BPK (if you want databaseversions of the components)

INSTALLING THE PACKAGES INTO DELPHI/C++ Builder:

On the menu select Component->Install Packages
Click add, and locate the compiled DSCITxx.BPL file
(it's located where your default BPL output path is).
Select the package, and thats it.

Do the same with DSCITDBxx.BPL (if you want databaseversions of the components)

FILENAME EXPLANATION AND EXAMPLES

xx = the version and compiler of the file

If the prefix is DCL then it's a designtime package,
otherwise it's a runtime.

If the word DB is in the filename, it's the database support.

Example:
SCIT19D7.BPL (Version 0.19 for Delphi 7)

The .bpi/.lib/.dcp files created is named with only the basename.

Example:
SCIT.DCP (for the same file as the example above)

OTHER COMPILERS

If you get the packages to compile with another Delphi/C++ Builder
version, give me a message, along with the package source for it.
i.e packagename.bpk,packagename.res,packagename.cpp (C++ Builder) or
packagename.dpk,packagename.cfg,packagename.dof,packagename.res (Delphi).
