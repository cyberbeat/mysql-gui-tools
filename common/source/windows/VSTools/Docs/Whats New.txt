23 December 2004
    - 12-14-04 - Fixed the problem with the Toolbar Images getting messed up
                 when a notification event occurs! Whoo-Hoo!
                - Fixed the problem where the treeview may lose it place during
                  a shell event and reset to no expanded nodes! Whoo-Hoo*2!
    - 11-10-04 - Fixed the fix from Robert and the focused node <G>.  It was
                 begin saved but not restored and it corrupted the stream.
    - 11-28-04 - Fixed bug in text color when full row selection on
                 and column > 1.  When selected columns > 1 text did not
                 respect the selected text color.
               - Added code to log shell notifications if {$DEFINE LOGSHELLEVENTS}
                 is enabled to find long standing annoying issues with refresh.
               - Started updating to VT 4.2.23, issues found. Talking with Mike.
                 Not backwards compatible must upgrade VT with new version of VSTools.
               - Fixed the TNamespace.ShowContextMenu so that the context menu
                 would show owner draw submenus it the Owner passed is not a
                 VET or decendent
               - Added an Active property to the Combobox.  WARNING its default
                 is not Active so you must set to true.
